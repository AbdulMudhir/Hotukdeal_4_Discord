# Hotukdeal_4_Discord
 
Wanted to check what deals are on Hotukdeals but don't want to keep heading over to the site?
The Hotukdeal_4_Discord would allow you to receive deals to your channels.

deals are checked every hour(this can be changed) and bot would only send deals that are already in the channel to prevent duplicate deals.

Expired deals are also filtered out and removed from the channel that way you would not see these deals.

You can view, price, comments, as well as receive direct links to the deals all from 1 space.
